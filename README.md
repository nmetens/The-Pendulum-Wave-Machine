# The-Pendulum-Wave-Machine

The Pendulum Wave Machine was my final project for a computational physics class at Portland State University in the spring of 2021. 
This youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2W6JrAvze8&t=5s inspired me to replicate the pendulum. 
I used python code and computational physics methods.
